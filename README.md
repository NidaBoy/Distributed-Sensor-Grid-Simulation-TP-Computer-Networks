# Distributed-Sensor-Grid-Simulation-TP-Computer-Networks
This a C/C++ programming project that simulates a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) using a client-server architecture and socket programming. This system models the dynamic behavior of distributed sensor nodes collecting and sharing environmental data on a defined 10x10 grid.
